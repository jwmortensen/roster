The goal of this project is to identify synergies and redundancies within NBA 
rosters. Our initial idea is to use a modified version of RAPM that includes
latent factors for different player types as a predictor variable, and then
examine interactions between the player type factors to identify potential
redundancies or synergies within a given roster.
